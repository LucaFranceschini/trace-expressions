The server processes GET requests by sending a response with the information associated with the file identified by the URL, if found.

The client sends GET requests with randomly generated correct and incorrect paths.

`benchmark-client.js` sends N (passed as argument) requests to the server without collecting its responses, and then computes the number of requests
per second (RPS).
