The server sends a response with 10MB data.

The correct client correctly consume the server response, while the buggy client
does not consume it, with a serious memory leak.

`benchmark-client.js` sends N (passed as argument) requests to the server without collecting its responses, and then computes the number of requests
per second (RPS).
