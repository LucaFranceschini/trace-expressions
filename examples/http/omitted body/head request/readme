The server receives an HTTP request and prints its body, if present,  on the stdout  

The correct client sends a HEAD request without body, as specified in the documentation  

The buggy client sends a HEAD request with a body which, however, cannot be received by the server 

`benchmark-client.js` sends N (passed as argument) requests to the server without collecting its responses, and then computes the number of requests
per second (RPS).
