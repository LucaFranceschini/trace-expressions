The client sends a GET request and prints the body of the response, if present.

The correct server sends a 304 response without body.

The buggy server sends a 304 response with a body which, however, cannot be received by the client.

`benchmark-client.js` sends N (passed as argument) requests to the server without collecting its responses, and then computes the number of requests
per second (RPS).
